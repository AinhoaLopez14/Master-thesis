# Supplementary material
This repository contains the supplementary material (tables, dataset) from my master's thesis. 
- **Supplementary_Tables**: This Excel file contains the supplementary tables from S1 to S6 that are cited in the main text of the master's thesis.
- **Supplementary_Dataset**: This Excel file contains 8 sheets
  - *Missing SNPs no filt*: Missing SNPs with their frequency for each population.
  - *Missing SNPs filt*: Missing SNPs after filtering for each population.
  - *MF_all*: Molecular function GO terms for the RDA dataset containing all populations obtained with GOATOOLS (Klopfenstein et al., 2018) with the transcripts associated with them, the environmental variable, and the normalized counts used for Figure 5 in the main text. 
  - *CC_all*:  Cellular Component GO terms for the RDA dataset containing all populations obtained with GOATOOLS (Klopfenstein et al., 2018) with the transcripts associated with them, the environmental variable, and the normalized counts used for Figure 5 in the main text.
  - *BP_all*:  Biological Process GO terms for the RDA dataset containing all populations obtained with GOATOOLS (Klopfenstein et al., 2018) with the transcripts associated with them, the environmental variable, and the normalized counts used for Figure 5 in the main text.
  - *MF_all*:  Molecular function GO terms for the RDA dataset containing only Mediterranean populations obtained with GOATOOLS (Klopfenstein et al., 2018) with the transcripts associated with them, the environmental variable, and the normalized counts used for Figure 5 in the main text.
